•	Create a function that takes a number as input and calculates its factorial using a loop.
•	The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.
•	The function should return the factorial of the input number.
•	Test the function with different numbers to make sure it is working correctly.

let num = 5;
let factorial = 1;

for (; num >0; num--) {
factorial=num*factorial;
 }
 
console.log (factorial);
