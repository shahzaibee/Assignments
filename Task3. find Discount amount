•	Create a function that takes a product price and a discount percentage as input and calculates the discount amount for the product using the formula: discount amount = product price * (discount percentage / 100).
•	If the discount percentage is greater than or equal to 50%, the function should return an error message indicating that the discount percentage is invalid.
•	Display the original price, discount percentage, discount amount, and final price of the product to the user as output.
•	Test the function with different product prices and discount percentages.

let discountFunc = (price:number, discountPercentage:number):void=>{

    let discountAmount:number = price * (discountPercentage/100)

    if(discountPercentage >= 50){
        console.log("The discount percentage is invalid.")
    } else{
        console.log(`orignal price: ${price}, discount percentage: ${discountPercentage}%, discount amount is: ${discountAmount}, final price is rs. ${price-discountAmount}`)
    }
    
}


discountFunc(200,40)
